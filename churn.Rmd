author: "Francis Kioni"
output: github_document

Dataset: Telecom Customer Churn Dataset available on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

RESEARCH QUESTION

To establish which factors cause customer churn and how can the telecommunication companies reduce customer attrition.

OBJECTIVES
I.	Identify relationships in the data

II.	Identify factors that contribute to the high attrition rate

III.	Visualize the findings

IV.	Give recommendations to the company

APPROACH

1.	The data was read in Rstudio and outliers removed.
2.	Exploratory data analysis was carried out to show descriptive statistics of the data. Histograms, scatter plots and boxplots were explored.
3.	Statistical analysis was carried out to identify the factors that are mostly related to customer attrition. Correlation analysis, simple logistic regression and decision trees were explored.

### decison tree algorithm
The decision tree explain the most significant factors that lead to customer churn. Contract, Tenure, online security and tech support were the most significant variables with the contract type carrying the most weight. From the decision tree a pie chart was created to examine in depth the way different contracts lead to churn
```r
##visualization
# Bar chart of churn rates by gender
df<-data.frame(churn_data)
churn_data$Churn <- ifelse(churn_data$Churn == "Yes", 1, ifelse(churn_data$Churn == "No", 0, ""))
churn_data$Churn <- as.numeric(churn_data$Churn)
churn_data$gender <- ifelse(churn_data$gender == "Male", 1, ifelse(churn_data$gender == "Female", 0, ""))

 
# Pie chart of churn rates by contract type
contract_churn <- aggregate(churn_data$Churn, by = list(churn_data$Contract), FUN = mean)
names(contract_churn) <- c("Contract", "Churn_Rate")
ggplot(contract_churn, aes(x = "", y = Churn_Rate, fill = Contract)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") +
  labs(title = "Churn Rates by Contract Type", fill = "Contract")
```

![Churn Rates by Contract Type](figure/unnamed-chunk-1-5.png)

From the above pie chart the churn rate is very high in customers having month-to-month contract. The two year contracts have the lowest level of attrition in this case. 

```r
#Bar chart of churn rates by gender
churn_data <- read.csv("C:/KIONI/brayo/churn.csv", header = TRUE)
ggplot(churn_data, aes(x = gender, fill = Churn)) +
  geom_bar(position=position_dodge()) +
  labs(title = "Churn Rates by Gender", x = "Gender", y = "Count")
```

![Churn Rates by Gender](figure/unnamed-chunk-1-6.png)

Female clients are more prone to churn than their male counterparts.

### RECOMMENDATIONS
A recommendation would be that the companies to adopt annual or 2 year contract plans than use the monthly contracts.  Improving tech support and online security will also reduce the churn rate.
